    "### What is Compression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compression is a method used to shrink the size of files in order to save storage space on a device.  When downloading content from the internet, we often encounter files with the extension .zip or .rar.  These are instances of files that have been compressed.  Upon opening, they create the 'original', accessible file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   There are diverse and complex schools of thought on how to approach compression, ranging from information theory to statistics.  And as we experience the age of big data, research in this field is in an incessant pursuit for more efficient compression methdos.  In general, the algorithms that make compression possible rely on some rather intuitive mathematical rules.  Text compression essentially remove redundancy from a file by removing redundant repeating characters (or patterns of characters), and keeping track of these in a dictionary.  For image compression, the same idea applies except instead of characters it manipulates pixels and their colors.  \n",
