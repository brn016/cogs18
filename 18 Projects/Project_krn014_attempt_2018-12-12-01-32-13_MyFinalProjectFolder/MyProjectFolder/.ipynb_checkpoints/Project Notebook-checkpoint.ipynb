    "This code is meant to run a western-themed 'choose your own adventure' prompt, taking in user input and printing different story scenarios and adding new items to a list depending on the inputs. The 'goal' of the adventure is to accumulate a certain amount of items in your list. With two items or more, the user 'wins' the game and recieves the printed statement \"Good job!\" or \"Better luck next time!\" \n",
