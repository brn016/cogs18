    "Animal Crossing is a real life simulation software developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. People can design users, create and manage their town, and interact with fellow villagers. This project is a quick demo of the full game itself. Users enter the Animal Crossing World, meet Rover, pick their town name, their name, and then meet Isabelle. Isabelle is the town's liason and assistant to the mayor, which is you. In this scenario, you will be chatting with Isabelle to learn more about the town and about your role as a mayor. Ask her questions related to the game/town and she will be more than happy to help! This game is a chatbot based experience, and is influenced heavily from assignment 3."
