    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Create a Chatbot that convinces our friend Nathan to come to Yosemite with us over winter break.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the archery club, we have \"families,\" which are essentially bigs and littles. Our family, named Dry Fire, has been planning a trip to Yosemite since November, and almost everyone is able to make it. The exceptions are those whose parents won't let them, the one who will be out of the country, and Nathan. Nathan is choosing to instead go to Big Bear with some other friends because they \"started planning first\" and he's afraid to be a flake. We've been trying to convince him to come for the past few weeks, but he keeps giving the same excuses, creating a situation predictable enough to be handled with a chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other things to note:\n",
    "1. Seaweed and white rice are his favorite foods, and can be used to tempt him.\n",
    "2. We're mostly trying to guilt trip him with our responses.\n",
    "3. He's in a safe environment; I made this partly because I thought it'd be funny, partly because I needed a project idea.\n",
    "4. We're not actually trying to pressure him into doing something he doesn't want to.\n",
    "5. When I told him I was doing this, he said, \"I don't know whether to feel special or attacked\".\n",
    "6. It's both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Love ya Nathan <3"
