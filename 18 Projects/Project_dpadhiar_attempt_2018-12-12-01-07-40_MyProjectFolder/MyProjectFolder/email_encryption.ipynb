    "DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project idea, I decided to expand on the encryption algorithms\n",
    "from Coding Assignment 2. I chose to use the smtplib module in order\n",
    "to send others emails as encrypted messages. The way this works is the\n",
    "package opens a connection with the gmail server, logs in with the\n",
    "credentials of the user and takes in both a message and a key. With that,\n",
    "it sends an email to the specified recipient. My code allows for\n",
    "decryption of messages as well. All the user has to do is let the\n",
    "program know they are decoding and it will construct the reverse\n",
    "algorithm using the given key. The encryption algorithm I decided to\n",
    "use is similar to the custom encoding of the base assignment. However,\n",
    "I had to expand on it because with custom encoding, it is very\n",
    "troublesome to decode if you do not change every letter. This is what\n",
    "I chose to do. The encoding simply shifts each letter over a certain\n",
    "amount specified by the key. If the key is 5, a will be f. It can be\n",
    "negative as well and for -5, a would be v. The key can also be larger\n",
    "than 26 as it is managed by %26. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided a Gmail account to use for testing as the code currently\n",
    "only opens a connection with Gmail. However, this can be changed by hand\n",
    "if the user would like to send from different accounts.\n",
    "Login: cogs18encryption@gmail.com Password: cogs18project\n",
    "I would recommend using this account when testing the use of my code. To\n",
    "allow Python to access your email account, you would need to turn on the\n",
    "setting \"Allow less secure apps\" if you wished to try. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third party source I used for the SMTP implementation was this site:\n",
    "https://realpython.com/python-send-email/ and I marked which parts their\n",
    "code was used."
