    "I decided to do a hangman game for this project because it's a fun and simple game I loved playing as a kid. Although back in my day we used to play hangman on chalkboards and whiteboards, creating a digital version to play on a computer is a doable task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Hangman game incorporates aspects of a chatbot due to the interaction the game has to have with the user. The game asks the user for a letter, and then the user has to guess one. If the letter is in the randomly chosen word, the game puts the letter in the space it is in the word. If the user's letter is not in the word, the game draws another body part of the hangman and tells the user their guess was wrong. The user continues guessing letters until they have either gotten the full word and won or if they have used up all their guesses and the hangman is complete. "
