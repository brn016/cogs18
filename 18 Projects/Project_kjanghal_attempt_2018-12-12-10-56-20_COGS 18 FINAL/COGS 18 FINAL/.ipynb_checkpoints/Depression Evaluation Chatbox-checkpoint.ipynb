    "# Depression Evaluation Chatbox\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbox is designed to ask you a series of questions about your symptoms and then analyze them to determine whether the symptomology you report is sufficient for a diagnosis of depression. The disgnostic criteria is based off the DSM V, more specifically, from this source: https://tourette.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DSM-5_Depressive_Disorders.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbox uses while loops to keep track of the questions being asked and responded to, stores the responses in an object Symptoms(), and then uses conditionals to analyze the inputs and genererate a report that is returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "- data  is collected over a series of while loops (while chat_count == 0 through 22)\n",
    "- not all questions detailed in the while lops are asked- if you indicate the presence of a symptom, you will be asked the frequency, and if you display sufficient symptoms you will be asked about certain exceptions (use of drugs, other medical conditions, presence of mania, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returning information\n",
    "\n",
    "- data is then analyzed during the 23th while loop and returned to the user at the end\n",
    "- each set of conditionals in the while loop analyzes a different part of the diagnostic process (the display of particular symptoms at specific frequencies, the presence of certain symptoms comorbid with anxiety, the presence of suicidality, etc.)."
