    "- Organize() is a file management function that can be used to organize folders that contain many files of different file types. \n",
    "- This works by:\n",
    "    1. Specifying a target folder/path\n",
    "    2. Creating a list of all files in the target folder\n",
    "    3. Creating new folders to sort files into (based on manual input)\n",
    "    4. Looping through the list of files and sending each file to its respective folder\n",
    "- Other functions are contained within the organize() function\n",
    "- Organize() is particularly useful for sorting an excess of homework files on a computer/laptop\n",
    "    1. Common homework formats (doc, pages, pdf, ipynb) can be sorted into their own folders/ categories"
