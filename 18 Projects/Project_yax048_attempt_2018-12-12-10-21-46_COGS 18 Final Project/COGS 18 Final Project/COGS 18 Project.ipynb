    "    1. make appointments\n",
    "    2. check appointments\n",
    "    3. cancel appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I create a class called reservation list which include methods to add, check and cancel appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with a dictionary called availiable which includes all avaliable times in it, and an empty dictionary called appointments which will includes all appointment times user make.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The add appointment method could move one key(with the time) from availiable dictionary to appointment dictionary, and adding job name.\n",
    "    The check appointment method could print out the item of a specific key which user enter.\n",
    "    The cancel appointment method could move one key(with the time) from appointment dictionary to availiable dictionary, and delete the job name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I create a chatbot use methods above to approch my goal."
